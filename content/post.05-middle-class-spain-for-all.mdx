First a disclaimer. I’m not an economist. This post is held together with a few
public links, vibes, some imagination, and an irresponsible amount of ChatGPT.
If you’re looking for a full macro model, you’re in the wrong pub.

This line of thinking is simple on purpose. I’m only really turning two knobs
here: how much the world produces (GDP) and how much energy it uses to support
everyday life. GDP tells us what level of material comfort is even on the table;
energy tells us whether that comfort can exist without wrecking the planet. I’m
explicitly talking about *physical possibility* under an assumption of
near‑maximum effort. I’m ignoring institutions, culture, geopolitics, and human
messiness — not because they don’t matter, but they effect the effort not the
physics.

If you take a rough look at the world economy, something like *middle‑class
Spain for everyone* is not obviously impossible, at least on paper, with an
incredibly strong green transition. World GDP per person (PPP — purchasing power
parity, which adjusts for cost‑of‑living differences so we’re comparing what
people can actually buy, not just exchange rates) is about \$24k today, while
Spain sits around \$46k ([World
Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD)). With a fairly modest 1.5–2%
global growth rate, that gap could close in roughly 30–40 years. No miracles,
just time, coordination, and a lot of infrastructure work.

The trick, of course, is that living standards aren’t the same thing as GDP.
Spain turns income into day‑to‑day well-being efficiently: universal healthcare,
compact cities, decent public transport, and life expectancy of about **83
years**, all while using far less energy than richer countries
([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/spain/); [Our World in
Data](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy)). Spread *that* model — public
services and density rather than endless private consumption — and you can get
decent lives without everyone driving a tank to the shops. Try to globalise U.S.
lifestyles and the whole thing falls over.

Energy and climate are where things stop being abstract. Today, the world emits
about 36–40 gigatonnes of CO₂ per year ([Our World in
Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)) in total,
while the remaining carbon budget for staying near 1.5–2°C is only on the order
of 300–500 gigatonnes ([Carbon Brief
explainer](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c/)).
If the whole world lived at Spain’s current emissions levels — roughly 5–6
tonnes of CO₂ per person per year — that budget would be exhausted in a few
decades, locking in dangerous warming, more extreme weather, and long‑term
damage that can’t be undone on human timescales, stretching for centuries.
Worse, we’d be building fossil‑fuel systems that would have to be torn out
almost as soon as they were finished — an expensive mess we’d leave to the next
generation.

The only version that survives contact with physics is a green one. Solar and
wind costs are down 80–90% since 2010, batteries about 85% cheaper ([Our World
in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth)).
If those trends were pushed hard — grids, electrification, efficiency — a mostly
clean global energy system could plausibly be built in 40–50 years, with
deployment rates about **2–3× today’s** (very roughly: we currently add
\~**500–600 GW** of clean power per year globally; most net‑zero pathways
require closer to **1–1.5 TW/year** sustained), still within historical
precedent — comparable to past build‑outs like mid‑20th‑century electrification,
post‑war reconstruction in Europe, or wartime industrial mobilization ([IEA Net
Zero by 2050](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050); [IPCC AR6
WGIII](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/)). That timeline lines up awkwardly
well with the 30–40 year income catch‑up window.

Physically, this might not be impossible. Politically, it looks grim. The
barrier isn’t technology or basic economics, it’s power — who gives up what so
everyone else can live a decent, ordinary life. On paper, middle‑class Spain for
all is feasible. In the real world, that’s where the arguments start.

If we accept that it’s physically possible, then what’s left is effort. Here
I’ve assumed *maximum* effort. How you actually get societies to choose that
level of effort is the real question. We already organise at that scale for wars
— and whether we like it or not, the green transition is one of those. The
difference is that this one’s about keeping the lights on, not turning them off.

Use of AI in this article: I used ChatGPT canvas to generate text, and fetch
the numbers, and I did reviews and many edits. I'd love to know what you think!
