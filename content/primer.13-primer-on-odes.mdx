## What is an ODE?

$$
F \left( t, y, y'(t), y''(t), \ldots, y^{(n)}(t) \right) = 0
$$

Where:
- $ t $ is the independent variable (often time)
- $ y $ is the dependent variable (the function we want to solve for)
- $ y'(t) $ is the first derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ t $
- $ y''(t) $ is the second derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ t $
- $ y(t)^{(n)} $ is the $ n $-th derivative of $ y $ with respect to $ t $
- $ F $ is a function that relates these variables

The *order* is the highest derivative in the ODE. The **degree** is the exponent 
of the highest-order derivative (after clearing fractions/roots, only defined for polynomial ODEs). It is **linear** if 
the function and its derivatives appear to power 1, with no products. It is **homogeneous** 
if RHS = 0; otherwise non-homogeneous. The **initial conditions** are function/derivative 
values at a point for a unique solution.

## Methods of Solving Analytically

### Separation of Variables

For first-order ODEs of the form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = g(t)h(y)
$$

Rearranging gives:

$$
\frac{1}{h(y)} dy = g(t) dt
$$

Integrating both sides:
$$
\int \frac{1}{h(y)} dy = \int g(t) dt
$$

Example:

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = ky
$$
$$
\frac{1}{y} dy = k dt
$$
$$
\ln |y| = kt + C
$$
$$
y = Ce^{kt}
$$

### Integrating Factors

For first-order linear ODEs of the form:
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} + P(t)y = Q(t)
$$
Multiply by the integrating factor:
$$
\mu(t) = e^{\int P(t) dt}
$$
Then:
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mu(t)y \right) = \mu(t)Q(t)
$$
Integrate both sides:
$$
\int \frac{d}{dt} \left( \mu(t)y \right) dt = \int \mu(t)Q(t) dt
$$
$$
\mu(t)y = \int \mu(t)Q(t) dt + C
$$
$$
y = \frac{1}{\mu(t)} \left( \int \mu(t)Q(t) dt + C \right)
$$

### Characteristic Equation
For linear ODEs with constant coefficients, such as:
$$
a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0
$$
Assume a solution of the form:
$$
y(t) = e^{rt}
$$
Substituting into the ODE gives the characteristic equation:
$$
a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0
$$
Solve for $ r $ to find the roots. The general solution depends on the nature of the roots:
- **Distinct Real Roots**:
$$
y(t) = C_1 e^{r_1 t} + C_2 e^{r_2 t} + \ldots + C_n e^{r_n t}
$$
- **Repeated Roots**:
$$
y(t) = (C_1 + C_2 t + \ldots + C_n t^{n-1}) e^{r t}
$$
- **Complex Roots**:
$$
y(t) = e^{\alpha t} \left( C_1 \cos(\beta t) + C_2 \sin(\beta t) \right)
$$
Where $ r = \alpha + i\beta $ are the complex roots.

## Methods of Solving Numerically
### Euler's Method
For first-order ODEs of the form:
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)
$$
1. Choose a step size $ h $ and initial condition $ y(t_0) = y_0 $.
2. Compute the next value:
$$
y(t_0 + h) = y_0 + h f(t_0, y_0)
$$
3. Repeat for subsequent points:
$$
y(t_{n+1}) = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)
$$
4. Continue until the desired range is covered.

## Workflow

### First Order ODEs

- **Check if separable**:
  - If yes → separate and integrate.
  - If no → check if linear:
    - If yes → use integrating factors.
    - If no → check if exact:
      - If yes → solve as exact.
      - If no → check if homogeneous:
        - If yes → try substitution.
        - If no → use numerical methods.
