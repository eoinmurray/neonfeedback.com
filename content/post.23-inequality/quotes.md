Being good at something is a debt, not a claim.

Being good at something is a privilege not a right, almost always when one is
good at something one is standing on the shoulders of others.

Power must be justified through consent.

Emergent inequality is still injustice.

Diffuse equalisation is necessary — even against unseen hierarchies.

Merit is real, but it warrants gratitude, not rule.

Better a thousand dissolvable nodes than one immortal node. Let legitimacy be
local, revocable, and laughable when it overreaches.

You're rejecting Lockean possessive logic ("I mixed my labor with it") in favor
of Kropotkinian mutual aid ("we meet needs together").

meritocracy is a kind of folk physics

Meritocracy is a kind of folk physics because it applies a linear, mechanistic,
Newtonian model to a domain — society — that behaves more like turbulence, not
billiards.

Folk physics assumes:
    Individual inputs (talent, effort)
    produce proportional outputs (success, wealth, influence)
    which can then be fairly attributed and rewarded

But in real complex systems:
    Small differences in initial conditions (e.g. school, network, chance exposure) amplify over time
    Feedback loops entrench tiny early wins into systemic advantages (e.g. the Matthew Effect)
    Outcomes emerge from networked interactions, not isolated agency
    Attribution is ambiguous — there is no ground truth for “who caused what”

So meritocracy, like folk physics, is an intuitive but wrong simplification — a
comforting fiction that tries to make chaotic systems feel just and orderly.

Practicals of building a working anarchism, which I'm afraid are beyond the
scope of this essay, whose limited scope is to show reader that anarchism is
something to be considered

Most inequality is unearned, unconsented to, and indefensible.

Political possibility is bounded mainly by the stories we allow ourselves to tell.

“The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.” — David Graeber, The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy (2015)
