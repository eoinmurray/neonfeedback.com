It seems to me that there are three closely related questions that get raised
when one imagines an ideal world. The first is "is the current world ideal,
given the capacities of humanity", the second is "in what broad
direction should we move", and the third is "where specifically do we want to
end up".

The first is pretty easy to answer. The second is also easy to answer, the third
is much more difficult, but we should not shy away from attempts to address it.

## The first question: Is the current world ideal, given the capacities of humanity?

Lets start with the first question, should we change things? If an alien came to
earth, what would they think, would they come to believe that the current system
is fair and just? I doubt it. I think they would observe many power structures
bearing down on the population, and I dont think they would be convinced of
those power structures self justifications. What is power?, well, its the
capacity to influence others, events and control resources.

Many such justifications exist for these power structures at the present moment,
and I believe most can be dismissed, except consent. To name a few: might,
divinity, charisma, tradition, law, utility, merit, morality, consent.

The first four can be dimissed together. Each is grounded not in reason or
justice, but in accident—accidents of strength, belief, personality, or history.
None offer a stable or justifiable standard by which the governed can evaluate
or contest authority

The last five; law, utility, merit, morality and consent require more careful
consideration. They can have justification if backed by carefully consent, but
only if so. Law and morality without consent is arbitrary, utility without
consent is untethered. Merit can be dismissed as a basis of power because it
disguises privilege as desert, rewarding the winners of an unfair game while
blaming the losers for losing.

This brings us to the only basis of power I believe in; consent. But its also
not without caveats. It must be democratic, without deficit, and immediately
revocable.

The alien would also observe unrestricted inequality where various social power
laws are allowed to exist. Even as the total wealth is growing, it is being
distributed highly unequally. Inequality is unjust because it concentrates
unconsented power. It does this through hierarchical structures justified by
myths, it perpetuates itself via systemic feedback loops, and it violates the
ethical demand that all power must continually justify itself—or be dismantled.

Why is this inequality bad? it Violates the principle that all are equal. It
hoards resources for the few. It limits access to opportunities for the many. It
gives people less control over their own destiny.

- This inequality is very material
- But its also mental

Many people believe that inequality can be justified. Lets tackle this. I think
inequality is unearned, unconsented to, and indefensible. When inequality is
unjust is should be repaired and egalitarianism implemented, which is always
except for a few justified situations.

## The second question: In what broad direction should we move?

Given we've whether the current system is reasonable, lets think of directions
we should move in.

Starting with the principle of consent, we should tear down power structures 
and heirarchies which violate this principle.

## The third question: Where specifically do we want to end up?
