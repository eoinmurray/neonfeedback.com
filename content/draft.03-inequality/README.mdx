When political arguments with friends come up, things often become detailed and
specific, which can be fruitful, but can also end up getting lost in the weeds.
To get back to basics, I often find it useful to come back to the following
questions to find some common ground.

1. Is the current world close to ideal, given human capacities?
2. If not, in what broad direction should we move?
3. Where, specifically, do we want to end up?

Typically everyone answers "no" to the first question. The second question
yields some version of "more equality, less concentrated power." The third
question gets interesting - and people’s visions diverge.

What follows is my personal take on these questions.

## 1. Is the current world ideal, given human capacities?

If an intelligent alien examined our world, I doubt they’d conclude our
arrangements are "ideal", or "the way things have to be." They’d notice
concentrations of historically contingent power (economic, political and
cultural), exercised over people who didn’t meaningfully choose them and can’t
meaningfully refuse them.

Most power structures offer a justification. These often include: might,
divinity, charisma, tradition, law, utility, merit, morality and consent.

I don’t personally find the first four (might, divinity, charisma, tradition)
compelling. If the justification is basically "because we can," "because God,"
"because that guy," or "because we’ve always done it," then the people on the
receiving end don’t really have a standard to appeal to, just a wall to bounce
off.

The remaining five deserve more care. Law, utility, merit, and morality *can*
help us coordinate - but only when they’re grounded in freely given, informed,
and revocable consent. Without that, law turns into "because it’s written
down," utility turns into spreadsheet coercion, morality turns into scolding,
and merit turns into ideology.

Merit in particular seems like a shaky justification for power. It can disguise
privilege as desert, reward winners of structurally unfair systems, and blame
losers for outcomes shaped by luck, network effects, and path dependence. Even
if we *could* perfectly attribute merit (I don’t think we can), it still
wouldn’t justify domination: no one chooses their talents, upbringing, or
initial conditions.

That leaves consent as the only defensible basis of power I can see - but
only under strict conditions. If we’re going to lean on consent, it has to mean
something like:

* Informed
* Freely given (not coerced by material necessity)
* Continuously renewable
* Revocable without penalty

Plenty of modern institutions don’t meet this test. If you’ve ever stayed in a
job you hated because you needed the health insurance, you already know what I
mean. Not in a philosophy-seminar way - in the everyday way of rent, jobs,
immigration status, health care, debt. Saying "you consented" in those
conditions can feel like a legal joke.

Our hypothetical outsider would also notice something else: unrestricted
inequality. Wealth, influence, security, and voice are distributed according
to extreme power laws. Even as total wealth grows, access to life choices can
narrow.

Inequality isn’t merely unfortunate. It’s unjust because it concentrates
unconsented power. It operates through hierarchical structures justified by
myths, reproduces itself through systemic feedback loops, and violates the
ethical demand that power must continually justify itself - or dissolve.

Inequality is material: it affects housing, health, education, and survival. But
it is also mental: it constrains imagination, normalizes domination, and trains
people to mistake necessity for nature.

A lot of inequality is unearned, unconsented to, and hard to defend with a
straight face.

So to summarize: no, I don’t think the current world is close to ideal, given human
capacities. It concentrates unconsented power through hierarchical structures
justified by shaky myths, and reproduces itself through systemic feedback loops.

## 2. In what broad direction should we move?

If you take consent seriously, the direction seems pretty clear.

We should move away from concentrated, inertial power and toward diffuse,
revocable, participatory structures. Any institution that can’t justify
itself to the people it affects - here and now - should lose authority.

That suggests stuff like:

* Power should be democratic without deficit
* Delegation should be temporary and recallable
* Exit should be a real option, not a legal fiction
* Institutions should be forkable - replaceable without catastrophe

One thing that matters here is treating inequality as a structural problem, not
a moral failure. Even "neutral" systems generate hierarchy through
autocatalytic feedback loops: early advantage compounds, visibility begets
trust, trust begets influence, influence begets power.

Even when inequality "emerges," it can still be injustice. Nature isn’t a moral
argument.

Correcting this requires diffuse equalization, not merely redistribution at
the margins. Basic needs should be guaranteed first - because vulnerability is
universal and (in principle) non-controversial. Luxury and preference come
later, if at all.

Being good at something isn’t a claim on other people. If anything, it’s a debt
- a sign that you’re standing on accumulated labor, knowledge, and care.

## 3. Where specifically do we want to end up?

Some call it anarchism. I know that word can be a conversation-stopper.

Not as chaos, but as post-meritocratic egalitarianism: a society organized
around consent, sufficiency, and mutual aid rather than rule. I mean it in a
narrow sense: no permanent rulers, and no status so high it turns into
authority.

In such a society:

* Excellence is recognized, but not elevated into authority, unless time limited.
* Expertise persuades; it does not command
* Property is replaced by use-rights that decay unless renewed by need
* Institutions exist to solve problems, then dissolve
* Power rots by default unless re-justified through consent

Governance would emerge through peer juries, consensus processes, and
revocable delegation. Majority rule is a last resort. Emergency powers exist
only by prior consent and expire automatically.

Culture itself becomes an immune system against hierarchy: satire, irreverence,
and a refusal to worship excellence help prevent domination from crystallizing.
Esteem replaces status; gratitude replaces entitlement.

Better a thousand dissolvable nodes than one immortal institution. Let
legitimacy be local, temporary, and laughable when it overreaches.


## Conclusion

One might call all these views fanciful, and thats fair, but remember that the
current state of affairs is just one configuration among many possible ones, and
its worth imagining alternatives.

Merit is real, but it warrants gratitude - not rule. Inequality can emerge
"naturally," but that doesn’t make it just. Power should continually justify
itself through consent - or be dismantled.

Political possibility is bounded mainly by the stories we allow ourselves to
tell. The story that hierarchy is inevitable, inequality is deserved, and
domination is necessary is a story - not a law of nature.

We can tell different ones, if we choose to.

Anyway, here’s my rough wishlist:

Let power decay unless re-justified.
Let institutions rot unless revived by real need.
Let excellence flourish without rising above its peers.
Let no one rule unless all agree - and let that agreement expire with the
morning.
