There are three closely related questions that arise whenever we try to imagine a just society:

1. **Is the current world close to ideal, given what humanity is capable of?**
2. **If not, in what broad direction should we move?**
3. **Where, specifically, do we want to end up?**

The first is easy. The second is also fairly easy. The third is hard — but avoiding it is itself a political choice.

## I. Is the current world ideal, given the capacities of humanity?

If an intelligent outsider were to examine our world, it is difficult to believe they would conclude that our social arrangements are fair or necessary. They would observe vast concentrations of power — economic, political, cultural — exercised over people who did not meaningfully choose them and cannot meaningfully refuse them.

Every existing power structure offers a justification. Historically and presently, these include:

* Might
* Divinity
* Charisma
* Tradition
* Law
* Utility
* Merit
* Morality
* Consent

The first four can be dismissed quickly. Power justified by force, faith, personality, or history rests on contingency, not legitimacy. They offer no standard by which those subjected to power can evaluate or challenge it.

The remaining five deserve more care. Law, utility, merit, and morality *can* play roles in social coordination — but only when grounded in **freely given, informed, and revocable consent**. Without consent, law becomes arbitrary, utility becomes technocratic coercion, morality becomes moralism, and merit becomes ideology.

Merit in particular fails as a justification for power. It disguises privilege as desert, rewards winners of structurally unfair systems, and blames losers for outcomes shaped by luck, network effects, and path dependence. Even perfect merit attribution would not justify domination: no one chooses their talents, upbringing, or initial conditions.

This leaves **consent** as the only defensible basis of power — but only under strict conditions. Consent must be:

* Informed
* Freely given (not coerced by material necessity)
* Continuously renewable
* Revocable without penalty

Most modern institutions fail this test.

An outsider would also notice something else: **unrestricted inequality**. Wealth, influence, security, and voice are distributed according to extreme power laws. Even as total wealth grows, access to life chances narrows.

Inequality is not merely unfortunate. It is unjust because it **concentrates unconsented power**. It operates through hierarchical structures justified by myths, reproduces itself through systemic feedback loops, and violates the ethical demand that power must continually justify itself — or dissolve.

Inequality is material: it affects housing, health, education, and survival.
But it is also mental: it constrains imagination, normalizes domination, and trains people to mistake necessity for nature.

Most inequality is unearned, unconsented to, and indefensible.


## II. In what broad direction should we move?

If we take consent seriously, the direction is clear.

We should move **away from concentrated, inertial power** and toward **diffuse, revocable, participatory structures**. Any institution that cannot justify itself to those it affects — here and now — should lose authority.

This implies:

* Power must be democratic **without deficit**
* Delegation must be **temporary and recallable**
* Exit must be a real option, not a legal fiction
* Institutions must be **forkable** — replaceable without catastrophe

Crucially, inequality must be treated as a structural problem, not a moral failure. Even “neutral” systems generate hierarchy through autocatalytic feedback loops: early advantage compounds, visibility begets trust, trust begets influence, influence begets power.

Emergent inequality is still injustice.

Correcting this requires **diffuse equalization**, not merely redistribution at the margins. Basic needs must be guaranteed first — because vulnerability is universal and non-controversial. Luxury and preference come later, if at all.

Being good at something is not a claim on others. It is a debt — a sign that one is standing on the accumulated labor, knowledge, and care of many.


## III. Where specifically do we want to end up?

Anarchism.

Not as chaos, but as **post-meritocratic egalitarianism**: a society organized around consent, sufficiency, and mutual aid rather than rule.

In such a society:

* Excellence is recognized, but never elevated into authority
* Expertise persuades; it does not command
* Property is replaced by **use-rights that decay** unless renewed by need
* Institutions exist to solve problems, then dissolve
* Power rots by default; entropy is a feature, not a flaw

Governance emerges through peer juries, consensus processes, and revocable delegation. Majority rule is a last resort. Emergency powers exist only by prior consent and expire automatically.

Culture itself becomes an immune system against hierarchy: satire, irreverence, and refusal to worship excellence prevent domination from crystallizing. Esteem replaces status; gratitude replaces entitlement.

Better a thousand dissolvable nodes than one immortal institution. Let legitimacy be local, temporary, and laughable when it overreaches.


## Conclusion

Merit is real, but it warrants gratitude — not rule.
Inequality can emerge naturally, but that does not make it just.
Power must continually justify itself through consent, or be dismantled.

Political possibility is bounded mainly by the stories we allow ourselves to tell. The story that hierarchy is inevitable, inequality is deserved, and domination is necessary is a story — not a law of nature.

We can tell different ones.

Let power decay unless re-justified.
Let institutions rot unless revived by real need.
Let excellence flourish without rising above its peers.
Let no one rule unless all agree — and let that agreement expire with the morning.
