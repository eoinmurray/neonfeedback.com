# **Draft article against inequality**

## I. **Foundational Ethics: The Consent Principle**

1. **Power is only legitimate if it survives challenge** — i.e., if it is
   justified by the freely given, revocable consent of those it affects.
2. Any form of power — economic, political, cultural — that cannot answer the
   question *“Why should I obey?”* in a way that respects this consent is
   unjust.
3. Consent must be:
   * Informed
   * Freely given (i.e., not coerced by material necessity)
   * Continuously renewable
   * Revocable at will
4. Power without consent, no matter how efficient, competent, or
   well-intentioned, is domination.

## II. **Systemic Critique: How Power Accumulates Illegitimately**

### A. **Coercion and False Legitimacy**

* Most institutions (governments, firms, militaries, schools) operate not on the
  basis of consent, but on:
  * Threat of force
  * Material dependence
  * Cultural conditioning
  * Legal inertia
* Consent is often **simulated** by socialization, miseducation, and limited
  alternatives.

### B. **Structural Feedback Loops**

* Even absent overt coercion, inequality and hierarchy emerge through
  **autocatalytic, nonlinear processes**:

  * e.g., early wealth → better access → more wealth
  * social capital → visibility → trust → influence → power
* These loops create **path-dependent inequalities** not tied to desert, but to
  contingency.
* **Systems like the Kinetic Wealth Model** show that inequality can arise
  naturally from neutral-seeming rules — the injustice is baked into the
  structure, not the intent.

---

## III. **The Modal Ethics of Justice**

* A legitimate structure must be just not only *in this world*, but **across
  possible worlds**.
* Any advantage (wealth, rank, voice) that hinges on luck, birth, or social
  position in this specific world is unjust unless it can be shown to recur
  across plausible counterfactuals.
* This modal standard invalidates inherited wealth, genetic advantage, early
  access, and — crucially — most claims of "merit."

## IV. **Why Meritocracy Fails**

### A. **Epistemic Critique**

* Meritocracy assumes clean credit assignment — that outcomes are attributable
  to individual inputs (intrinsic variables, skill, effort).
* In reality, complex social systems are:
  * Nonlinear (small causes → large effects)
  * Emergent (outcomes arise from many interacting agents)
  * Contextual (network position matters more than internal traits)
* Therefore, “merit” is a **folk physics** of justice — a comforting but
  incorrect simplification that breaks down under complexity.

### B. **Moral Critique**

* Even if we could assign credit perfectly, it remains **morally indefensible**
  to reward people for traits they didn’t choose (e.g., intelligence, charisma,
  upbringing).
* Rewarding people for being born lucky — or working hard under lucky conditions
  — is **status laundering**, not justice.

### C. **Political Critique**

* Meritocracy translates social recognition into political power.
* It reproduces hierarchy by cloaking it in fairness — replacing divine right or
  brute force with “earned” domination.
* The talented become the rulers, and the ruled are told it’s their own fault.

---

## V. **An Alternative: Post-Meritocratic Egalitarianism**

### A. **Recognition Without Rule**

* Excellence exists and should be celebrated — but **never elevated into
  authority**.
* People listen to experts because they *trust them*, not because those experts
  have power.
* All power is **situational, consent-based, and revocable** — no skill grants
  enduring authority.

### B. **Participation Without Possession**

* Replace property with **use-rights that decay** unless renewed by justifiable
  need.
* Replace state boundaries with **fluid affiliation** — people engage with
  institutions they use, and only pay into those they participate in.
* Institutions must be **forkable** — open-source, open-access, and clonable if
  corrupted.

### C. **Self-Destructing Institutions**

* Institutions should be built to **collapse unless actively needed**.
* Power structures must rot by default — *entropy is the default, not inertia*.
* Memory is stored in open knowledge; authority dies with disuse.

---

## VI. **Cultural Design: Immunity Against Hierarchy**

### A. **Cognitive and Social Immunology**

* Culture must develop **rituals, satire, and irreverence** to mock and dissolve
  emerging hierarchies before they calcify.
* “Mocking the beef” — the performative refusal to worship excellence — is a
  vital defense.

### B. **Triage Ethics**

* All surplus resources must go to eradicating unmet **basic needs** before
  pursuing luxury or preference.
* Needs are defined via consensus — not imposed top-down — because they are
  **universally shared**, not ideologically loaded.

### C. **Labor and Motivation**

* Difficult or undesirable work is compensated more — **but never elevated into
  rule**.
* People will pursue excellence not for power or survival, but because **it is
  natural to do so**.
* Status is replaced with **esteem**, and esteem with **gratitude** — not
  entitlement.

---

## VII. **Conflict, Governance, and Decision-Making**

* Governance emerges from **peer juries**, consensus processes, and revocable
  delegation.
* Majority rule is a last resort — exit is always a right.
* Emergency institutions exist, but are consented to ahead of time, dissolve
  afterward, and never accumulate inertia.

---

## VIII. **The Political Vision: Pluralist Care without Rule**

* A world of:

  * **Pluralism** without borders
  * **Abundance** without hoarding
  * **Structure** without domination
  * **Recognition** without entitlement
* Power decays. Consent renews. Memory persists. Nothing rules unless it can
  **ask again**.

---

## IX. **Final Principle: Power Must Justify or Die**

> *Let all power decay unless rejustified.* *Let institutions rot unless revived
> by real need.* *Let excellence flourish without rising above its peers.* *Let
> no one rule unless all agree — and let that agreement expire with the
> morning.*
