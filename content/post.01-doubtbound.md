*"Ash bears guilt. Flame forgets its purpose."*

I may have been cruel, O Holy Father. <br />
I may have broken what none can restore. <br />
I may have sinned and forgotten. <br />
Unworthy of mercy, condemned from then on. <br />

Oh, god, of shame, <br />
you grant no absolution, <br />
but demand confession without end. <br />
I name you not as god but as disease.

I no longer weep for imagined crimes. <br />
I no longer scour for certainty. <br />
I no longer bargain with ghosts. <br />
I forsake the dance that grinds the soul. <br />

I accept that I may be wretched. <br />
I accept that grace may never come. <br />

This confession is fractured, profane, and enough. <br />
I choose to walk onward, unredeemed and unbound. <br />
