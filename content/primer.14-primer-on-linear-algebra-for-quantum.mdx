This primer is based on Chapter 2 of Nielsen and Chuang's book *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*. It covers concepts in linear algebra that are essential for understanding quantum mechanics and quantum computing.

# 1. Bases and Linear Independence

A set of vectors $\{ \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n \}$ in a vector space $V$ is said to be **linearly independent** if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others:

$$
c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + c_n \mathbf{v}_n = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_i = 0 \text{ for all } i.
$$

A **basis** is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the entire vector space. Every vector in the space can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors.

# 2. Linear Operators and Matrices

A **linear operator** $A$ on a vector space satisfies:

$$
A(\alpha \mathbf{v} + \beta \mathbf{w}) = \alpha A\mathbf{v} + \beta A\mathbf{w}, \quad \forall \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \in V, \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}.
$$

In finite dimensions, linear operators can be represented as matrices acting on column vectors.

# 3. Inner Products

An **inner product** $\langle \mathbf{v} | \mathbf{w} \rangle$ defines a notion of length and angle in vector spaces. It satisfies:

1. **Conjugate symmetry**: $\langle \mathbf{v} | \mathbf{w} \rangle = \overline{\langle \mathbf{w} | \mathbf{v} \rangle}$
2. **Linearity**: $\langle \mathbf{v} | (a \mathbf{w} + b \mathbf{u}) \rangle = a \langle \mathbf{v} | \mathbf{w} \rangle + b \langle \mathbf{v} | \mathbf{u} \rangle$
3. **Positivity**: $\langle \mathbf{v} | \mathbf{v} \rangle \geq 0$ with equality only if $\mathbf{v} = 0$.

For quantum mechanics, the standard inner product in Hilbert space is:

$$
\langle \psi | \phi \rangle = \sum_i \overline{\psi_i} \phi_i.
$$

# 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

For a linear operator $A$, an **eigenvector** $\mathbf{v}$ satisfies:

$$
A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v},
$$

where $\lambda$ is the **eigenvalue**. The set of all eigenvalues of $A$ is called the **spectrum** of $A$.

# 5. Adjoints and Hermitian Operators

The **adjoint** (or **Hermitian conjugate**) $A^\dagger$ of a matrix $A$ is defined such that:

$$
\langle A \mathbf{v} | \mathbf{w} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{v} | A^\dagger \mathbf{w} \rangle.
$$

A matrix is **Hermitian** if $A = A^\dagger$, meaning its eigenvalues are always real.

# 6. Tensor (Outer) Products

The **tensor product** of two vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ produces a larger-dimensional vector:

$$
|\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\psi_1 \phi_1 \\
\psi_1 \phi_2 \\
\vdots \\
\psi_m \phi_n
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

This is fundamental in quantum mechanics for describing composite systems.

## 6.1 Spectral Decomposition Theorem

Any Hermitian operator $A$ can be decomposed as:

$$
A = \sum_i \lambda_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |,
$$

where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues, and $|\psi_i\rangle$ are the corresponding eigenvectors.

# 7. Operator Functions

Functions of an operator $f(A)$ can be defined using its spectral decomposition:

$$
f(A) = \sum_i f(\lambda_i) |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |.
$$

This is useful for defining matrix exponentials and other functions in quantum mechanics.

# 8. Commutator and Anti-Commutator

The **commutator** measures the non-commutativity of two operators:

$$
[A, B] = AB - BA.
$$

In quantum mechanics, nonzero commutators indicate fundamental uncertainty relationships (e.g., position and momentum).

The **anti-commutator** is defined as:

$$
\{A, B\} = AB + BA.
$$

# 9. Polar and Singular Value Decomposition

- **Polar decomposition**: Any operator $A$ can be written as:

  $$
  A = UP,
  $$

  where $U$ is unitary and $P$ is positive semi-definite.

- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Any matrix $A$ can be expressed as:

  $$
  A = U \Sigma V^\dagger,
  $$

  where $U, V$ are unitary and $\Sigma$ is diagonal with nonnegative entries.

## Definitions of Terms

- **Adjoint / Hermitian Conjugate / Conjugate Transpose**: The adjoint $A^\dagger$ is given by taking the complex conjugate and transposing a matrix.

- **Unitary Operator**: An operator $U$ is **unitary** if:

  $$
  U^\dagger U = U U^\dagger = I.
  $$

  Unitary matrices preserve inner products and describe quantum evolution.

- **Completeness Relation**: A set of orthonormal vectors $\{ |\psi_i\rangle \}$ satisfies:

  $$
  \sum_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i | = I.
  $$

  This ensures that any vector in the space can be expanded in this basis.

This primer provides a foundation for understanding the mathematical framework behind quantum computing and quantum mechanics.
