The Boltzmann distribution describes the probability of a system being in a particular energy state $ E_i $ at thermal equilibrium. It arises from statistical mechanics by maximizing entropy subject to constraints.


## 1. Entropy and Probability Distribution

The entropy $ S $ of a system is defined as:

$$
S = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i
$$

where:
- $ k_B $ is Boltzmann's constant,
- $ p_i $ is the probability of the system being in state $ i $,
- The sum is over all possible states $ i $.


## 2. Constraints

Two constraints are imposed:
1. **Probabilities must sum to 1**:
   $$
   \sum_i p_i = 1
   $$

  This ensures the probabilities $ p_i $ form a valid distribution. Without this, the solution wouldn’t represent meaningful probabilities for the system's states.

2. **Energy conservation**:
   $$
   \langle E \rangle = \textnormal{constant} =  \sum_i p_i E_i
   $$
   where $ E_i $ is the energy of state $ i $. This constraint ensures that while individual particles may exchange energy, the total energy across all particles in the system remains constant.


## 3. Maximizing Entropy

To find the probability distribution $ \{p_i\} $, maximize the entropy $ S $ under the constraints using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function:
$$
\mathcal{L} = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i + \alpha \left( \sum_i p_i - 1 \right) + \beta \left( \sum_i p_i E_i - \langle E \rangle \right)
$$
where $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are Lagrange multipliers.


## 4. Solving the Optimization Problem

Take the derivative of $ \mathcal{L} $ with respect to $ p_i $:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial p_i} = -k_B (1 + \ln p_i) + \alpha + \beta E_i
$$
Set $ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial p_i} = 0 $:
$$
-k_B (1 + \ln p_i) + \alpha + \beta E_i = 0
$$
Simplify to express $ p_i $:
$$
\ln p_i = -\frac{\alpha}{k_B} - \frac{\beta E_i}{k_B} - 1
$$
Exponentiate both sides:
$$
p_i = \exp\left(-\frac{\alpha}{k_B} - 1\right) \exp\left(-\frac{\beta E_i}{k_B}\right)
$$
Define $ Z = \exp\left(-\frac{\alpha}{k_B} - 1\right) $, known as the **partition function**:
$$
Z = \sum_i \exp\left(-\frac{\beta E_i}{k_B}\right)
$$
Thus:
$$
p_i = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\beta E_i}{k_B}\right)}{Z}
$$


## 5. Interpretation of Parameters

- $ \beta $ is related to the temperature $ T $ by $ \beta = 1/T $ (in natural units).
- The partition function $ Z $ ensures normalization of probabilities:
  $$
  \sum_i p_i = 1
  $$


## 6. Final Result

The Boltzmann distribution is:
$$
p_i = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E_i}{k_B T}\right)}{\sum_i \exp\left(-\frac{E_i}{k_B T}\right)}
$$
This describes the probability of the system occupying the energy state $ E_i $ at temperature $ T $.
