# I dream in green

The Republic of Ireland is a small, young country with unusually strong
capacity for reinvention. That mix of demographics, social trust, and fiscal
windfalls makes it a plausible test bed for ambitious reforms.

## Why Ireland feels ripe for utopian thinking

- Young population (median age ~38) suggests openness to change.

- Highest share of tertiary-educated young adults in the EU gives deep human
  capital.

- High social trust provides a baseline for collective action.

- Small population (~5.2 million) can enable faster policy iteration.

- Large surpluses and a new sovereign wealth fund create rare fiscal room.

## What is negative, and why that also fuels imagination

- Severe housing scarcity and some of the highest rents in the EU create
  visible pressure.

  status quo.
