Logarithms are the "inverse of exponentiation." If you’ve ever wondered **“what power of a number produces another number?”**, you’re working with logarithms. This primer introduces logarithms, explains their properties, and proves those properties step by step.

## **What is a Logarithm?**

The logarithm answers the question:  
**"To what power must the base be raised to produce a given number?"**

Mathematically:
$$
\log_b(x) = y \quad \text{means} \quad b^y = x
$$
- $b$: the **base** of the logarithm (e.g., 2, 10, or $e$).
- $x$: the number you’re taking the logarithm of.
- $y$: the exponent.

### Example:
$\log_2(8) = 3$ because $2^3 = 8$.


## **Key Properties of Logarithms**

Logarithms simplify complex operations. Below are the fundamental properties, along with proofs.


### **1. Product Rule**  
$$
\log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)
$$

**Proof**:  
1. Let $\log_b(x) = p$ and $\log_b(y) = q$. By the definition of logarithms:
   $$
   b^p = x \quad \text{and} \quad b^q = y
   $$
2. The product $xy$ is:
   $$
   xy = b^p \cdot b^q
   $$
3. By the laws of exponents, $b^p \cdot b^q = b^{p+q}$, so:
   $$
   xy = b^{p+q}
   $$
4. Take $\log_b$ of both sides:
   $$
   \log_b(xy) = \log_b(b^{p+q})
   $$
5. By the property $\log_b(b^k) = k$, we get:
   $$
   \log_b(xy) = p + q
   $$
6. Substitute back $p = \log_b(x)$ and $q = \log_b(y)$:
   $$
   \log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)
   $$


### **2. Quotient Rule**  
$$
\log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)
$$

**Proof**:  
1. Let $\log_b(x) = p$ and $\log_b(y) = q$. By the definition of logarithms:
   $$
   b^p = x \quad \text{and} \quad b^q = y
   $$
2. The quotient $\frac{x}{y}$ is:
   $$
   \frac{x}{y} = \frac{b^p}{b^q}
   $$
3. By the laws of exponents, $\frac{b^p}{b^q} = b^{p-q}$, so:
   $$
   \frac{x}{y} = b^{p-q}
   $$
4. Take $\log_b$ of both sides:
   $$
   \log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(b^{p-q})
   $$
5. By the property $\log_b(b^k) = k$, we get:
   $$
   \log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = p - q
   $$
6. Substitute back $p = \log_b(x)$ and $q = \log_b(y)$:
   $$
   \log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)
   $$


### **3. Power Rule**  
$$
\log_b(x^k) = k \cdot \log_b(x)
$$

**Proof**:  
1. Let $\log_b(x) = p$. By the definition of logarithms:
   $$
   b^p = x
   $$
2. Raise both sides to the power $k$:
   $$
   (b^p)^k = x^k
   $$
3. By the laws of exponents, $(b^p)^k = b^{pk}$, so:
   $$
   x^k = b^{pk}
   $$
4. Take $\log_b$ of both sides:
   $$
   \log_b(x^k) = \log_b(b^{pk})
   $$
5. By the property $\log_b(b^k) = k$, we get:
   $$
   \log_b(x^k) = pk
   $$
6. Substitute back $p = \log_b(x)$:
   $$
   \log_b(x^k) = k \cdot \log_b(x)
   $$


### **4. Change of Base Formula**  
$$
\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}
$$

**Proof**:  
1. Let $\log_b(x) = p$. By the definition of logarithms:
   $$
   b^p = x
   $$
2. Take $\log_k$ of both sides (using a new base $k$):
   $$
   \log_k(b^p) = \log_k(x)
   $$
3. By the power rule, $\log_k(b^p) = p \cdot \log_k(b)$:
   $$
   p \cdot \log_k(b) = \log_k(x)
   $$
4. Solve for $p$:
   $$
   p = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}
   $$
5. Recall that $p = \log_b(x)$, so:
   $$
   \log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}
   $$


## **Applications of Logarithms**

Logarithms have widespread applications:
- **Growth and Decay**: Population dynamics, radioactive decay, and compound interest.
- **Scales**: Decibels (sound), pH (acidity), and earthquake magnitudes.
- **Computing**: Algorithm efficiency (e.g., $O(\log n)$), binary trees, and compression.


### **Quick Practice Problems**
1. Prove $\log_b(1) = 0$.
2. Simplify $\log_2(16)$.
3. Solve for $x$: $10^{\log(x)} = 1000$.
